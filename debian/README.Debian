smarty3 for Debian
------------------

In order to use Smarty 3 from your php scripts, you'll have to add
/usr/share/php/smarty3 on the include_path of php, that is in the
file /etc/php/{apache,apache2}/php.ini or use
require("smarty3/Smarty.class.php");

On smarty update, please note you will have to clear out all smarty
generated files, by default in a templates_c directory.
